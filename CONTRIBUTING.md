# Contributing to Radiant.NET

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

So all code changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2.0 Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

```markdown
Title: Short and descriptive example bug report

A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.

1. This is the first step
2. This is the second step
3. Further steps, etc.

`<url>` - a link to the reduced test case

Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their merits).
```

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* Follow the [C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions)
